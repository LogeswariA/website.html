<H2> 1. Brown Rice </H2>
<P><center>You might be surprised to see any kind of rice on this list,  
but is actually a great source of minerals, fiber, and vitamins.
 Unlike white rice, brown rice is less processed which enables 
it to have more nutritional value. Thanks to its fiber content, 
brown rice has a low glycemic index which allows it to regulate 
blood sugar levels helping you maintain steady energy levels
 throughout the day.</center></p>
<h2>2. Fatty Fish</h2>
<p><center>This is due to the omega-3 fatty acids which reduce the
 inflammation in the body â€“ a common cause of fatigue. 
In addition to that, vitamin B12 works together with folic acid 
producing red blood cells and helping iron work better in 
your body which increases energy.</center></p>
<h2>3.Bananas </H2>
<P><CENTER>Bananas  are probably one of the most well-known
 sources of energy. These fruits contain a lot of vitamin B6 and
 potassium as well as carbohydrates, which makes them an excellent 
source of power.

drink before yet another competition. Imagine how useful they can be 
to non-athletes. To find out more about the value of bananas

<h2>4. Eggs</h2>
<p><center>Eggs, consumed in any form, are a protein-rich energizing food. 
They don't cause spikes in blood sugar and insulin when digested making them 
a steady and sustained source of energy.

Eggs are also rich in B vitamins which help enzymes perform their role and break
 down food for energy effectively. Furthermore, leucine, which is known to stimulate 
energy production in several ways, is the most abundant amino acid in eggs.</center></p>
<h2>5. Yogurt</h2>
<p><center>ogurt is packed both with protein and carbohydrates, so eating this 
energizing food during the day as a snack is perfect to give you a boost. 
The carbohydrates in yogurt are mostly in the form of simple sugars such as lactose
 and galactose which can provide you with ready-to-use energy when broken down.


The proteins, on the other hand, slow down the digestion of carbohydrates and 
slow down the release of sugars into the blood. The vitamins B2 and B12 help the
 formation of molecule ATP which is somewhat of fuel for your cells. </center></p>
